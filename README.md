Picross Solver:

I've been playing Mario's Picross (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario's_Picross) for years now and I thought it might be a fun learning exercise to use Python to solve Picross puzzles. This may mean replicating the whole experience or just handing some agent the Picross hints and getting the completed picture. 

Once that initial build is done, I'd like to explore how I can extend it. Can I measure how challenging a puzzle is? If so, can I find an optimally challenging grid? How effecient is the solver? How quickly can it solve problems as the grid increases in size? What about if it increases in dimensions?
